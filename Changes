  - Fix bug where substr with replacement that shrinks the buffer would leave
    un-wiped bytes at the end of the string.
  - Fix compile error on some older gcc
  - New methods: splice, append
  - substr, splice, append, and assign now all have special cases for assigning
    a Span of a buffer.
  - New C API functions:
     - secret_buffer_SvPVbyte
     - secret_buffer_splice
     - secret_buffer_splice_sv
  - Removed the short-lived secret_buffer_assign_sv from the previous release
    since secret_buffer_splice_sv provides a more powerful way to do it.
